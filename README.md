## What I learned

In this project Ive implemented some basics of JavaScript.
* Functions
* Conditional Statements
* Loops
* Generating random values

I've understood the concepts of how these control flow statements work but, to put them into practice to build a program was a new challenge. Ive learned placing variables in the proper scope is very important. Having a basic pseudo layout of ideas and execution was also valuable in keeping this project well structured. Finding bugs in my program was a great learning experience for getting a deeper understanding of how these concepts all work together.
